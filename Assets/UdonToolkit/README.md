## Quick Start Guide

### Requirements

- [Udon Sharp Compiler](https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp) (v0.18+)
- [Optional] PostProcessing from Unity Package Manager (required for the Camera System)

## Installation

- Grab the latest package [from releases](https://github.com/orels1/UdonToolkit/releases)
- Import it into the project
    - If you're upgrading from version prior to 0.4.0 - you'll need to close and open the scene again after import
- A welcome screen will appear with links to documentation
- Open your `Project Settings` -> `UdonSharp` and in the `Default Behaviour Editor` select `UdonToolkit Editor`

> It is required to use the default path when importing as for now asset paths are hardcoded
